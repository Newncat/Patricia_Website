I hope that you had a fantastic day and weekend for your very special day, full of custard, zumba, non-alcoholic wine and reading :D You so deserve it because you are such a special person and absolutely amazing! You always know how to make people smile, laugh their hearts out, dance like there is no tomorrow or simply cheer them up when they need! You are an example for many of us with your endless kindness to everyone - including strangers who lose their coats! Remember how we met up as two lost under-age freshers? Ah the good old days, and how many amazing times we've had together since :) We've both moved on now (well almost) but even on the other side of the world from each other, I know that we will always keep in touch and I miss seeing you everyday. But I love how it's always as if we've never left each other when we meet up again -  this is an amazing friendship! Have a great GREAT time for your birthday and enjoy your drinking.;) Lots of love ! x  </h5> </div>



        <div class="col-sm-6"> <img src="images/Sarah2.jpg" class="center-block img-responsive" > <h5 id = "Agnes">  It seems a long time since we met in Mary's office. Much has changed since then. I'm no longer scared of you, and I've realized that the serious expression which frightened me so much on our first meeting is far from your usual demeanour. More importantly, we've become great friends. I had so, so many happy days with you at Newnham. The giggly conversations about this boy that I kind of liked, my awful snooker playing, your excellent time-keeping and a range of funny/wonderful/terrifying supervisions. I missed you so much in third year supervisions and you will always be my first port of call for discussions of Will Shakey. I consider you at least partly responsible for my marriage, from your initial vetting of a certain young vet to your romantic May Ball photography, through the VERY excitable conversation after I got engaged (I think you were at the airport?!) to my hen party and the big day, where you helped me with my make-up. All in all, you've been an epic friend. I love and miss you so much. The handbag you gave me is a treasure; faithful and large, but eclipsed in these qualities by the giver's heart. Ok, that's hardly Shakespeare, but I think he would have appreciated the sentiment! In short, you're awesome, and I love you. Farnham is too far away. I'm excited for your Birthday and getting to see you after too long! All my love, and God Bless you ! x  </h5> </div>

I have no doubt that it'll be at least as good as Farnham's only club... Make sure to have plenty of Pimms or perhaps an Old Mout Cider now that you can drink again. Thought I'd include this selfie - although no one is brushing their teeth it's still a great photo, and would have been worthy of Instagram if it were square. Hope you have a really great day ! x </h5> </div>

You are without a doubt one of the most joyous, enthusiastic and amusing people I know, and your habit of laughing uproariously at almost anything I say never fails to boost the ego... May your cup ever overflow with happiness, and your favourite member of One Direction spontaneously choose to wed you. Also may TaySway eventually end up with someone you approve of, and John Mayer write you a personal serenade ! x </h5> </div>

Your caring and loving personality is so genuine. I thought this photo tells a good story: firstly how much of a laugh we have together, secondly how when you stop playing hard to get, you make me too happy it would seem p Haha. Looking forward to a lifetime of friendship ! x   </h5> </div>
